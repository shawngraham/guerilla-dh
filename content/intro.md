The sources for the history of our times are [fragile](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/gothamist-dnainfo-shut-down-as-billionaire-ricketts-cites-costs). Joe Ricketts, the billionaire owner of DNAInfo and Gothamist, shut the local news publications down rather than tolerate a unionized workforce.

As public historians, what are we to do about this? There are a lot of issues highlighted here, but let's start at the most basic. _It takes nothing to delete the record_. The fragility of materials online is both a danger, and an opportunity, for us. Some scholars have ["gone rogue"](https://www.wired.com/2017/01/rogue-scientists-race-save-climate-data-trump/) in trying to deal with this problem. That is to say, they neither sought nor obtained permission. They just scoped out a process, and _did_ it.

I initially called this class 'guerrilla public digital history' partly tongue in cheek. I imagined us doing some augmented reality type projects in public spaces. Reprogramming those public spaces. Using digital techs to surface hidden histories, and insert them into spaces where they didn't 'belong'. Counterprogramming. That was the 'guerilla' bit.

I still want to do all that. But I think we're going to have to do a bit more. Digital Public Historians have a role to play I suspect in countering the information power asymmetry. These ways are impromptu, without authorization. Rogue. Improvised.

What is a 'guerilla digital public history'?

I'm still not sure- but let's find out together.
