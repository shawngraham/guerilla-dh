**NB** As the schedule, supporting readings, and work we do can change rapidly, I'm electing to use the Wiki attached to this course repository for handling any updates. [Please check the course wiki for the latest course information & syllabus.](https://github.com/shawngraham/guerrilla-dh/wiki)

At a minimum, you'll need:

+ an account with [Github](http://github.com) _or_ a domain of your own
+ an account with [Hypothesis](http://hypothes.is)

Whether or not you use your own name in any part of your username is up to you - you can be pseudonymous.

Join our class collaborative web annotation group [here](https://hypothes.is/groups/zX4N5ekd/guerilla-dh). If you've not used Hypothesis before, [here is some help](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Hypothesis is a tool for collaborative open annotation and you will get out of it what you put in.

## Do I need to be 'techy'?

What does that mean, 'techy'? It's worth pondering. Short answer: no. If you can write an email, there's nothing we'll do in this course that is beyond you.

## But what happens if something doesn't work?

That is, in many ways, part of the point. Things will break. It's when things break that we discover how best they can serve the broader goal. You will keep track of what you do, what you're thinking, as you experiment and push yourself.

## Glorious Failure is as valuable as Glorious Success

An ambitious project that succeeds is _just as_ important to me as an ambitious project that fails spectacularly: both earn high grades! Document everything, and swing for the bleachers. _That_ is the recipe for success. You're welcome to play it safe, but know that playing it safe leads to lower grades.
