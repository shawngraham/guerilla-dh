> [...a guerrilla narrative is the] interrupting [of] mainstream organized narratives through counter hegemonic storytelling, and the sabotage of toxic narratives ...  particularly those which reproduce or silence injustice... Methodologically, adopting a guerrilla narrative approach implies a commitment towards the co-design and co-production of knowledge and the recognition of storytelling as a fundamental tool in this process.  - Iengo, Ilenia and Armiero, M. The politicization of ill bodies in Campania, Italy. Journal of Political Ecology 24 (2017) [http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf](http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf)

> Guerrilla narrative can also be considered an expansion of the oral history methodology to include word-based memoirs, images, videos, audio recordings, and different forms of art among the different storytelling tools. Moreover, the expression guerrilla narrative implies the exercise of storytelling as a deliberate counter-hegemonic strategy, with an explicit political aim. - Ilenia Iengo and Marco Armiero "Toxic Bios: A guerrilla narrative project mapping contamination, illness and resistance" 3 Nov 2017 [https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/](https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/)

What are the stories in Ottawa that require a guerilla digital public history?

What do you need to know in order to tell such a story?

In this course, we will develop a guerilla digital public history cookbook and perhaps even put some of it into practice.
