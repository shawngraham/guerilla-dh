## Shawn Graham

I'm Associate Professor of Digital Humanities in the Department of History at Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.

No one is more surprised by this than me.

#### Interests
+ Computational Creativity for History & Archaeology
+ Open Access Everything
+ Digital Public History & Archaeology

![This is me][1]

I'm currently working on things like machine learning, and the [dodgy trade in human remains](http://bonetrade.github.io), as well as [computational creativity and archaeological legacy data](http://shawngraham.github.io/CCAD). Last year I published a [textbook on digital archaeology with its own integrated computational environment](http://o-date.github.io). In 2017 I designed, built, and launched a journal for creativity in history and archaeology called [Epoiesen](http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca). There are over 30 pieces published there which you might find inspirational.

### Contact

You can find me most mornings in the Starbucks in the Library. Or in PA406. By chance or appointment.
