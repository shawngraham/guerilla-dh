This is a studio course. We will spend very little time _in class_ on readings, as such; when we do discuss such things, it will be to provide context for what we are _doing_. I'm inspired very much by the work of historian Bill Turkle, who says to his own students in a similar kind of studio-led course,

> Most of your in-class time will be devoted to experimenting with various kinds of technologies and learning how to apply them.  It is playful and open-ended, and most of the drive has to come from you.  I provide tools and equipment, I can show you how it works and suggest ways you might use it, and if you get stuck I can help you figure out a way forward.

That goes for us too.

This can be disappointing if you are expecting a more traditional arrangement. If you want to learn how to do computational analysis of historical texts, I'd suggest the self-directed version of [Crafting Digital History](http://craftingdigitalhistory.ca) would be more appropriate for you. But in _this_ class, we're doing something very different.

If you have questions or concerns, get in touch right away.
