<p>The sources for the history of our times are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/gothamist-dnainfo-shut-down-as-billionaire-ricketts-cites-costs">fragile</a>. Joe Ricketts, the billionaire owner of DNAInfo and Gothamist, shut the local news publications down rather than tolerate a unionized workforce. For 11 minutes, <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/11/03/twitter-briefly-and-immeasurab.html">Trump was kicked off Twitter</a>. Ian Bogost sees in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/sorry-that-page-doesnt-exist/544934/">both episodes a symptom of a deeper problem</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>both are pulling on the same brittle levers that have made the contemporary social, economic, and political environment so lawless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As public historians, what are we to do about this? There are a lot of issues highlighted here, but let&rsquo;s start at the most basic. <em>It takes nothing to delete the record</em>. The fragility of materials online is both a danger, and an opportunity, for us. Some scholars have <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/01/rogue-scientists-race-save-climate-data-trump/">&ldquo;gone rogue&rdquo;</a> in trying to deal with this problem. That is to say, they neither sought nor obtained permission. They just scoped out a process, and <em>did</em> it.</p>

<p>I initially called this class &lsquo;guerrilla public digital history&rsquo; partly tongue in cheek. I imagined us doing some augmented reality type projects in public spaces. Reprogramming those public spaces. Using digital techs to surface hidden histories, and insert them into spaces where they didn&rsquo;t &lsquo;belong&rsquo;. Counterprogramming. That was the &lsquo;guerilla&rsquo; bit.</p>

<p>I still want to do all that. But I think we&rsquo;re going to have to do a bit more. Digital Public Historians have a role to play I suspect in countering the information power asymmetry. These ways are impromptu, without authorization. Rogue. Improvised.</p>

<p>What is a &lsquo;guerilla digital public history&rsquo;?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not sure- but let&rsquo;s find out together.</p>

  <h1>The Question</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;a guerrilla narrative is the] interrupting [of] mainstream organized narratives through counter hegemonic storytelling, and the sabotage of toxic narratives &hellip;  particularly those which reproduce or silence injustice&hellip; Methodologically, adopting a guerrilla narrative approach implies a commitment towards the co-design and co-production of knowledge and the recognition of storytelling as a fundamental tool in this process.  - Iengo, Ilenia and Armiero, M. The politicization of ill bodies in Campania, Italy. Journal of Political Ecology 24 (2017) <a href="http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf">http://jpe.library.arizona.edu/volume_24/Iengoarmiero.pdf</a></p>

<p>Guerrilla narrative can also be considered an expansion of the oral history methodology to include word-based memoirs, images, videos, audio recordings, and different forms of art among the different storytelling tools. Moreover, the expression guerrilla narrative implies the exercise of storytelling as a deliberate counter-hegemonic strategy, with an explicit political aim. - Ilenia Iengo and Marco Armiero &ldquo;Toxic Bios: A guerrilla narrative project mapping contamination, illness and resistance&rdquo; 3 Nov 2017 <a href="https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/">https://entitleblog.org/2017/11/03/toxic-bios-a-guerrilla-narrative-project-mapping-contamination-illness-and-resistance/</a></p>

<p>What are the stories in Ottawa that require a guerrilla digital public history?</p>

<p>What do you need to know in order to tell such a story?</p>

<p>In this course, we will develop a guerrilla digital public history cookbook and perhaps even put some of it into practice.</p>

<p>This is a studio course. We will spend very little time <em>in class</em> on readings, as such; when we do discuss such things, it will be to provide context for what we are <em>doing</em>. I&rsquo;m inspired very much by the work of historian Bill Turkle, who says to his own students in a similar kind of studio-led course,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of your in-class time will be devoted to experimenting with various kinds of technologies and learning how to apply them.  It is playful and open-ended, and most of the drive has to come from you.  I provide tools and equipment, I can show you how it works and suggest ways you might use it, and if you get stuck I can help you figure out a way forward.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That goes for us too.</p>

<p>This can be disappointing if you are expecting a more traditional arrangement. If you want to learn how to do computational analysis of historical texts, I&rsquo;d suggest the self-directed version of <a href="http://craftingdigitalhistory.ca">Crafting Digital History</a> would be more appropriate for you. But in <em>this</em> class, we&rsquo;re doing something very different.</p>

<p>If you have questions or concerns, get in touch right away.</p>

<p><strong>NB</strong> As the schedule, supporting readings, and work we do can change rapidly, I&rsquo;m electing to use the Wiki attached to this course repository for handling any updates. <a href="https://github.com/shawngraham/guerilla-dh/wiki">Please check the course wiki for the latest course information &amp; syllabus.</a></p>

<p>At a minimum, you&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>an account with <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> <em>or</em> a domain of your own</li>
<li>an account with <a href="http://hypothes.is">Hypothesis</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Whether or not you use your own name in any part of your username is up to you - you can be pseudonymous.</p>

<p>Join our class collaborative web annotation group <a href="https://hypothes.is/groups/zX4N5ekd/guerilla-dh">here</a>. If you&rsquo;ve not used Hypothesis before, <a href="https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/">here is some help</a>. Hypothesis is a tool for collaborative open annotation and you will get out of it what you put in.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-techy">Do I need to be &lsquo;techy&rsquo;?</h2>

<p>What does that mean, &lsquo;techy&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s worth pondering. Short answer: no. If you can write an email, there&rsquo;s nothing we&rsquo;ll do in this course that is beyond you.</p>

<h2 id="but-what-happens-if-something-doesn-t-work">But what happens if something doesn&rsquo;t work?</h2>

<p>That is, in many ways, part of the point. Things will break. It&rsquo;s when things break that we discover how best they can serve the broader goal. You will keep track of what you do, what you&rsquo;re thinking, as you experiment and push yourself.</p>

<h2 id="glorious-failure-is-as-valuable-as-glorious-success">Glorious Failure is as valuable as Glorious Success</h2>

<p>An ambitious project that succeeds is <em>just as</em> important to me as an ambitious project that fails spectacularly: both earn high grades! Document everything, and swing for the bleachers. <em>That</em> is the recipe for success. You&rsquo;re welcome to play it safe, but know that playing it safe leads to lower grades.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on things like machine learning, and the <a href="http://bonetrade.github.io">dodgy trade in human remains</a>, as well as <a href="http://shawngraham.github.io/CCAD">computational creativity and archaeological legacy data</a>. Last year I published a <a href="http://o-date.github.io">textbook on digital archaeology with its own integrated computational environment</a>. In 2017 I designed, built, and launched a journal for creativity in history and archaeology called <a href="http://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca">Epoiesen</a>. There are over 30 pieces published there which you might find inspirational.</p>
